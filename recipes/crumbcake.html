    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Streuselkuchen, also known in English-speaking countries 
        as crumb cake, is a cake made of yeast dough covered with 
        a sweet crumb topping referred to as streusel. The main 
        ingredients for the crumbs are sugar, butter, and flour, 
        which are mixed at a 1:1:2 ratio.

    <h3>For the Cake</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, spooned into measuring cup and leveled-off</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 stick (4 ounces) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>   
    <h3>For the Crumb Topping</h3> 
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the melted butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt.</li>
        <li>Using a spoon, stir in the cake flour one cup at a time, until the mixture forms a cohesive dough, like a very thick and clumpy cookie dough.</li>
        <li>As you add the last cup of flour, the mixture will be difficult to stir, so feel free to ditch the spoon and use your hands to mix it in.</li>
        <li>Set aside</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>For the Cake</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and set an oven rack to the middle position. Grease a 9 x 13-in cake pan.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the softened butter and granulated sugar on medium-high speed, scraping the bowl as necessary, until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one at a time, beating until incorporated after each addition (don't worry if the batter looks a little curdled at this point).</li>
        <li>Beat in the vanilla and scrape the bowl to make sure everything is evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Add the flour mixture alternately with the sour cream (half of the flour/all of the sour cream/then the remaining half of the flour), mixing on low speed with each addition, until just combined.</li>
        <li>Spread the cake batter evenly in the cake pan (it will only come about ¾ inch up the sides of the pan).</li>
        <li>Top the batter with the streusel crumbs, using your fingers to break it apart and form it into roughly ½-inch chunks. </li>
        <li>Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until a cake tester inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Let the cake cool fully on a rack.</li>
        <li>Dust with powdered sugar and cut into squares to serve.</li>
        <li>Cover the cake with aluminum foil and store at room temperature; it will keep nicely for up to 3 days.</li>
        <li>To keep the cake fresher longer, store it in the refrigerator but bring it to room temperature before serving.</li>
    </ol>
